## OVERVIEW:

This project developing a Command-Line Interface (CLI) project using Python for a Contact Book Management System. The project should apply Python concepts, Graphic User Interface (GUI) or external libraries are not required—everything should run directly in the terminal.

## TASKS:

Add Contacts:

Save to File:

- Store all contact information in your chosen file (e.g., .txt, .csv, etc.).
